ILIE RĂSCOLEAN,
GABRIELA CORINA SLUSARIUC, IMOLA DRIGĂ *
 ABSTRACT: Patrimonial analysis of financial stability is realized with the help of
some indicator determined on the balance: working capital; required working capital and net
treasury. These indicators are determined and presented in evolution at two companies with
different situations, and there are given conclusions and suggestions concerning achieving and
maintaining the financial equilibrium or initiating corrective measures in time, before the
imbalance would take irrecoverable forms.
 KEY WORDS: financial stability; working capital, own working capital; working
capital necessary; net treasury; level of liquidity.
 JEL CLASSIFICATION: D50; G32.
1. INTRODUCTION
The term of financial stability can be presented according to two conceptions
of elaboration of the balance: patrimonial and functional. Patrimonial analysis or
liquidity-chargeability emphasizes the capacity of the enterprise to pay at the maturity,
the bond to the third parties, highlighting the risk of insolvency.
Building the financial balance is realized by defining some objective criteria
on which the evaluation of cash and chargeability of the patrimonial elements of the
enterprise. The indicators of financial stability are: working capital, working capital
necessary and net treasury.
Financial stability has on its basis the fundamental relation of treasury:
working capital = working capital requirement + net treasury. For defining and
calculating the indicators of financial stability, assets elements and liabilities elements
are grouped on duration criterion of actives and passives. Therefore, assets elements

are grouped in fixed assets with liquidity of more than one year and assets with a high
degree of liquidity, under one year. Internal structure of the balance can be presented
based on duration criterion of assets and liabilities. Therefore, assets positions are
structured according to liquidity, and liability positions according to chargeability.
 Assets can be classified by their level of liquidity that indicates the possibility
to be transformed in money, sooner or later under normal terms of use. Some assets are
destined to be consumed in a longer period, more than a year, being considered assets
or fixed assets, with a lower degree of liquidity. This category consists of tangible
assets, intangible assets, financial assets and an intermediate type so called assets in
progress.
 Tangible assets include land and fixed assets. Lands are divided in two
categories: lands and arrangements of lands. Lands are registered at the adding in
patrimony, at the acquisition value or as a contribution, and usually are no subject to
depreciation, and investments in arrangement of lands are subject to depreciation.
 Fixed assets represents singular objects or a complex of objects that fulfil
cumulative the following conditions: have a higher value than the limit established by
law; have a normal duration of use longer than a year. For objects that are used in
batches, sets or form a single body, at their classification in fixed assets are taken into
account the value of the entire body, set or batch.
 Intangible assets include: trading fund, constitution expenses, concessions,
patents, licenses and other intangible assets.
 Financial assets include equity securities, fixed receivables of portfolio
activities, other fixed receivables long term receivables.
 Assets in progress are formed by intangible and tangible assets in progress. In
progress intangible assets represents the cost of production, respectively the cost of
acquisition afferent to unfinished intangible assets till the end of financial year.
Tangible assets in progress represents the unfinished investments made in own account
or contracting, which is assessed by production cost, respectively acquisition cost,
representing the price estimate of the investment. Tangible assets in progress are in the
category of fixed assets after the reception, putting into operation.
Fixed assets are characterized by a low level of liquidity, differentiated
according to their nature, capable of depreciation or not, and for those which are
according to normal duration of use. The level of liquidity can be influenced by some
operations like releasing some fixed assets. They are also named permanent allocation
due to slower rotation of capitals invested in them.
A part of the assets are consumed in exploitation, the level of liquidity being
less than one year. These assets, out of which cash availability are in the form of
money, have a high level of liquidity. In this category are circulating assets, current
assets being formed by various categories of stocks: raw materials, production in
progress, finished products, goods, debts and cash availability.
 Current assets meet the following conditions:
- are accomplished and held for sale or consumption in normal course of
exploitation of the enterprise, usually under 12 months;
- are held mainly for trading;
- represents cash or cash equivalent which use is not restricted.
 Patrimonial Analysis of Financial Stability 247
 Debts include, firstly, commercial debts and also claims from third parties,
individuals or legal entities. Trade receivables represents amounts to collect from
clients, to whom have been delivered goods or services, and by contract terms it was
accepted to collect the consideration at la later date. Cash availability include money
held in own cash desk, availabilities in current accounts opened at credit institutions,
banking deposits etc. To be qualified as current assets cash availabilities must be
available for current use.
 Current assets are also named cyclic allocations or temporary because the
recovery of invested capitals in these, are achieved at the end of one exploitation cycle
(supply – production - sale). Liabilities can be structured by the level of payment due
– it falls due at a certain date. Therefore, every liability corresponds to a bond or
pledge but the payment obligations are differentiated by very different due. Also some
liabilities don’t have any constraints to fall due, in this category being ownership
equity.
 Ownership equity represents the residual interest in the assets of the enterprise
after deduction of all debts, containing net, cumulative result, of all transactions and
previous events. In the category of ownership equity are: primary capital, bonuses
linked to capital, reserves, re-evaluation reserves, reported result, other ownership
equity. Primary capital represents an important element of ownership equity being
equal with the nominal value of the shares, respectively with the value of capital
contribution, bonuses and reserves incorporated or other operations that lead to a
change.
 Current regulations compel or give the possibility to enterprises to establish
some types of reserves: legal reserves; statutory reserves; re-evaluation reserves; other
reserves. Therefore, those that mandatory constitutes, on the basis of some Decisions
of General Meeting of Shareholders are non-deductible.
Ownership equity has a low exigibility level and is named permanent sources
or stable. Some liabilities, like debts involve a firm obligation to refund, and the level
of chargeability is different according to their payment due date.
So these medium and long term debts are also in the permanent or stable sources, their
chargeability degree being longer than one year.
 Long and medium term debts include credits for financing investments and
other debts. According to the source or origin of those who lend, borrowed sources for
long term can be categorized in: debenture; loans from specialized public institutions;
loans from the state; credits from credit institutions.
Long term credits are various in their nature and object. Short term debts or
current debts include exploitation debts and short term credits. They are characterized
by a high level of chargeability, also named cyclical or temporary sources, contracted
usually for exploitation cycle. Current liabilities fulfil some criteria: are settled in the
normal course of exploitation cycle of the enterprise, with payment to fall on 12
months; the firm does not have irrevocable right to postpone the payment after 12
months from balance sheet.
Exploitation liabilities include obligations resulted in exploitation cycle:
liabilities to suppliers, to employees, obligations to public budget; liabilities to
shareholders; other liabilities. Short term credits represents credits contracted from
248 Răscolean, I.; Slusariuc, G.C.; Drigă, I.
credit institutions for cycle exploitation necessities. Liabilities are grouped in
permanent capital that include ownership equity and other liabilities with payment to
fall more than one year and short term debts with payment to fall in less than one year.
 Permanent allocations, in fixed assets are usually covered by permanent
sources. If permanent sources are higher that permanent necessities for fund allocation,
this surplus issued by financing cycle of investments can be circulated for renewal of
stocks and debts; this potential use determined its name – working capital.

2. PROBLEM FORMULATION
2.1. Working capital
Working capital is the expression of financial balance achievement for long
term and its contribution to gain short term financial stability (Stancu, 1997, pp 446).
Working capital is determined by the relation:
Working capital = permanent capital – permanent allocations = (ownership equity +
long and medium term debts) – (fixed assets)
 This determination by calculation of working capital is the most relevant, from
the point of view of its mean.
 Working capital can also be determined:
Working capital = circulating assets – short term debts
 Working capital determined on the basis of patrimonial balance is named net
global working capital. If the working capital is positive that means the permanent
sources are overlapping for financing permanent allocations. In the situation where
working capital is negative, permanent sources does not assure fully financing of fixed
assets, where there is insufficient working capital. So, a positive working capital
reveals a state of financial balance because of fixed assets are financed, in a sustainable
manner, by using stable sources, mainly ownership equity, and also long and medium
term credits.
 The negative working capital indicates a state of financial imbalance because
the permanent sources are insufficient for financing permanent allocations, and in this
situation there is a demand for short term sources, at the expense of exploitation cycle
necessities.
 In the stage of market economy transition, many enterprises especially those
with state capital or privatized with negative working capital due to the end with losses
of several financial exercises that lead to diminishing of ownership equity. Under these
circumstances they were forced to turn for cyclic sources help for necessities of
permanent allocation and mostly these sources were unpaid liabilities to fall due by
suppliers and especially to state budget, local budget, state social security budget,
special funds. This phenomenon is shown, under some circumstances, but according to
market economy mechanisms these enterprises will enter inevitably in bankruptcy
procedure.
 Patrimonial Analysis of Financial Stability 249
 Working capital can be analyzed according to the structure of permanent
capitals, respectively ownership equity and long and medium term debts. This analysis
gives us the opportunity to highlight in which measure the financial stability is
achieved by ownership equity, respectively the degree of financial autonomy of the
enterprise. The indicator that reveals this level of autonomy is named own working
capital and highlights the surplus of ownership equity from fixed net assets.
Own working capital (FRP) is determined:
FRP = ownership equity – fixed assets
Likewise can be determined working capital loan (FRI) as a difference
between working capital and own working capital.
FRI = FR – FRP
 Working capital loan (foreign) expresses the amount of resources loaned on
long term, destined for financing short term fixed assets.
2.2. Working capital needs
The financing necessities of exploitation cycle are generally covered from
temporary sources also named exploitation debts or liabilities. The financing
necessities of exploitation cycle, which are also named cyclic or temporary uses
represents short term allocations that the enterprise must do for formation of stocks of
raw materials, production in progress, finished products, goods and also to pay
different dues to the clients.
Therefore, the enterprise must source with goods to resell if it has trade
activities with raw materials for making finished products and also with auxiliary
materials for deploying the trading activity, and also to storage these.
Also, in trading relations with the clients we must have some payment
deadlines, accumulating debts that generate financing necessities.
In the same time, by deployed activity the enterprise records debts to suppliers
from which obtained certain payment deadlines of supplied goods consideration or
services from them. Among short term debts there are some enterprise liabilities
toward the employees, shareholders, state, etc. Till the due of mentioned liabilities,
these represent financing sources or current activities. The difference between
necessities of exploitation cycle financing and exploitation liabilities is named
necessary working capital (NFR).
NFR = cyclic allocations – cyclic sources = (stocks + debts) – exploitation liabilities
Interpreting the positive or negative values of working capital must also
consider the causes that led to these situations. Therefore, if the difference between
cyclic allocations and cyclic sources is positive, that means a surplus of necessities of
exploitation cycle reported to its formation sources. This situation can be appreciated
as normal if is due to growing financing necessities, determined by development of the
250 Răscolean, I.; Slusariuc, G.C.; Drigă, I.
activity, or it can be the result of a negative gap between stocks and debts liquidity and
chargeability debts.
If the difference between cyclic allocation and cyclic sources is negative, that
means a surplus of temporary sources reported to circulating assets needs. This
situation can be seen as normal if is due to rotation acceleration of circulating assets
and some debts with more relaxed due, otherwise can be the result of some temporary
interruption in supplying and renewal of stocks and increasing if exploitation liabilities
because unpaid dues.
2.3. Net treasury
The components of net treasury are the assets and liabilities of the treasury,
where cash availability take a special place. Out of financial assets we mention:
investment securities, received commercial effects, bonds. The treasury liabilities
represent short term credits: cash credit, current account credit balance, mobilization
loans receivable.
 The formula of treasury is:
Net treasury (TN) = active treasury – passive treasury
 Treasury can be determined on the basis of equation of financial stability:
FR = NFR + TN
where: T = FR – NFR
 A positive treasury is the result of deploying an efficient activity and reflects a
state of financial stability of the enterprise that assures financial autonomy on short
term. According to the surplus of treasury there is the problem of efficiently placing in
the financial – monetary market. Negative net treasury highlights a potential financial
imbalance and translates to a monetary deficit that must be covered by short term
credits that have a higher cost and in the same time high level of payment due.
 Between profitability and treasury there are inter-conditioning relations. So,
deploying profitable activities creates the premises of obtaining positive treasury, and a
positive treasury directly influences the possibility to obtain the demanded level of
profitability.
 A profitable enterprise does not necessary has a positive treasury, this
depending on financial necessities variations and also the favourable or unfavourable
gap between the dues of collections and the dues of payments.
 In an enterprise, the static analysis of financial stability can be realized on three
levels:
- long term equilibrium where is used indicator of working capital through
which are compared permanent resources with permanent uses;
- short term stability where id used the indicator of working capital necessary by
which are compared temporary resources with temporary uses;
- current equilibrium where it follows the level or treasury, by comparing the
availabilities with the level of temporary banking credits.

In the analysis of the correlation between working capital and circulating
assets can be used a series of rates like:
Financing rate of circulating capital = (working capital / Circulating assets) * 100
Rate of stocks coverage = (Working capital / Stocks)*100
252 Răscolean, I.; Slusariuc, G.C.; Drigă, I.
In the next tables are presented the rates determined for the first company
Table 3. Financing rate of circulating capital

1 Circulating assets lei 1253077 1232061 1111561
2 Working capital lei 390130 278890 250351
3 Financing rate of circulating
capital % 31.14 22.64 22.53
This rate reflects the proportion of working capital that covers circulating
assets. The normal size of this rate must be over 50%. After calculations we can see
that in the analysed period this rate has obtained abnormal lower values.
Table 4. Rate of stock coverage

2 Working capital Lei 390130 278890 250351
3 Financing rate of circulating
capital % 84,55 60.08 58.20
 This rate reflects the proportion of which working capital finance the stocks.
After calculations results that the company situation in good, in the sense that
indicators are in normal limits. To note the fact that the stocks can be covered mostly
by permanent sources.
 In the following tables are presented the determined rates for the second
company.

2 Working capital lei 133933 84016 -99375
3 Financing rate of circulating
capital % 12.3 9.69 -12.65
Here we can see that in the analysed period this rate has obtained very low
values, and in 2010 they are negative.
After making the calculations results that the situation of company is not good
because the indicators are not in the normal limits.

4. CONCLUSIONS
The situation presented in the table no. 1reflects a state of financial stability,
in a company, realized on the working capital that records positive value for all years
taken into study, inclusively at the level of own working capital. Therefore, permanent
sources constituted by ownership equity and long term credits, assures the financing
totally of allocations in fixed assets, making a surplus that can be used for covering
some necessities of exploitation cycle.
The recorded values follow descending trend mainly because of reducing
balance of long term credits, as a result of payment of dues, when the company is in a
capitalization process, and the profits assigned for development have as an effect the
increasing of ownership equity.
Working capital necessary records, as well, positive values, with an
increasing trend in 2009 that can be explained by reducing the level of payment due of
exploitation liabilities, mainly the debts to suppliers of goods and services.
In 2010 the working capital necessary is reduced by a better correlation
between current assets liquidity and exploitation liability chargeability, mainly due to
improvement of the gap between medium duration of collection of debts and medium
duration of payment of liabilities. We put up the fact that the company does not have
any remaining debts.
The fact that the company has an overall profitable activity, recording profit
in all analyzed year creates the premises of recording a positive net treasury. Therefore,
there are recorded positive values in 2008 and 2010 due to accomplishing a positive
advance between current assets liquidity and chargeability of exploitation liabilities
especially a positive gap between medium duration of debts collection from clients and
medium duration of liability payment to suppliers.
It can be observed, that in 2009, net treasury records negative values because
of a unfavourable gap between debts liquidity and chargeability of exploitation
liabilities, by increasing the average debt collection from clients – beneficiary of
delivered goods.
Situation presented in table 2 reflects, in 2008, a state of financial balance
achieved by working capital by contracting some short term credits, for financing some
investments, resulting a surplus that can be used for covering some necessities of
exploitation cycle. This situation is maintained over the year 2009, even though there is
a descending trend, reflected in the negative values of own working capital and
because reducing ownership equity by recording losses.
254 Răscolean, I.; Slusariuc, G.C.; Drigă, I.
In 2010 are also recorded losses, the process of disinvestment being continued,
and the negative values express a state of financial imbalance. Permanent sources do
not assure financing anymore to long term assets, and due to the fact that the company
cannot access new credit because it records losses, it’s constrained to call short term
sources.
This situation is observed by following the evolution of working capital
necessary, the descending trend is due to the incapacity of the company to pay the
debts at due assumed to the third parties. Otherwise this unfavourable evolution is also
reflected at the level of net treasury. For improving the financial stability, before it
takes irrecoverable forms, there are needed urgent measures, or the company will enter
bankruptcy. It is necessary urgent capitalization by increasing the capital, achieved by
new contributions of the shareholders and some efficient measure for make it
profitable.
